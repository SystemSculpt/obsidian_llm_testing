# obsidian_llm_testing

A starter template that will be progressively built on with (soon-to-be) automated scoring and testing.

## Features that will be added over time

- [ ] Automated testing with a simple script
- [ ] Automated scoring and local storage of results of all the LLMs you've tested
- [ ] A simple UI for viewing your results

...and a lot more. Again, this is just a starter template.
